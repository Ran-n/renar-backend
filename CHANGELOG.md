# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Anti-abuse system (`security.py`): honeypot paths, unknown-route probe
  detection, per-IP rate limiting/flood bans, per-account login backoff,
  and persisted repeat-offender strikes that escalate a temporary ban into
  a permanent one (`strikes` / `banned_ips` tables) — see
  `docs/anti-abuse.md` and `docs/environment-variables.md`
- Admin panel (`routers/admin.py`, HTML behind HTTP Basic): user manager
  with per-user usage stats, comment manager, ban/strike management
- `GET /media/ratings` (community average rating) and
  `POST /media/{id}/rewatch` (log a rewatch of an item or one episode)
- Per-episode comment scoping alongside the existing per-title threads
- Book support end-to-end (`routers/books.py`, Open Library proxy)
- TVDB fallback lookup (`TVDB_API_KEY`) for TV Time import matching when
  the TMDB crosswalk misses
- `tests/` — pytest suite covering every endpoint's happy and error paths
  against a throwaway SQLite database
- `docs/` — environment variable reference and anti-abuse write-up

### Changed

- Split `media_items` into `titles` (shared metadata) and `library_entries`
  (per-user tracking state), with `WatchEvent` for rewatch history
- Comment payloads include the author's avatar

### Fixed

- Unique constraint on media item identity to prevent duplicate titles
